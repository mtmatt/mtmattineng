		<p>What‚Äôs the distance between the ideal and relaity? Some people think it is very far. ‚ÄúHowever, it‚Äôs not as far as your imagination.‚Äù I try to think like this,but it‚Äôs so odd that I can‚Äôt believe it. After reaserch for 20 years, I found some reason why people disapoint in the world.<br>####First, politics<br>In many countries, almost half people upset about the result in every election. Vote is realy useless though I can do this.<br>####Second, office and school<br>Many childran were told that school is a small society. How would childran think about the society when they were bullied by their classmate and school system. Obviously, they would think there are massive trash in the world. And some of them will take this imagination in to there office. Dispointed and exhausted, most of the people begin upset day and night.<br>####However, that‚Äôs not our all life<br>It‚Äôs no saying that our life is always bad. There are always many thing great in our life. Nevertheless, how do we find our pleasure will be the most important thing.</p>

		<p>This was in a summer vacation, in 2010. We were going to the Janhusun Fancyworld. A fancy world lying in Yunlin. Chatting in the car, we arrived. It was a special fancy world with two part, land world and water world. We can‚Äôt go into water world because we hadn‚Äôt bought the ticket. We had a nice day until my brother‚Äôs phone lost in the Janhusun Fancyworld. We went fast to find his phone. Finally, we found his phone, and we were exhausted when we were in the hotel.<br>That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like to go to fancy world as a trip. I found that when anyone goes to a fancy world for a trip, they will always be exhausted and upset. But some people will feel boring when the trip without exciting things, I think maybe we should find a balance between excited and relax, or we will feel either bored or upset.</p>
<p>This story is not true.</p>

		<p>When summer vacation began, Brawl Stars started crashing. Red Wi-Fi all the time. I think it is because many children are playing with this game, and the server can‚Äôt bear. I won‚Äôt play this game until this problem fixed.</p>

		<p>After I participated three AtCoder Beginner Contests(208,209,210), I found I can just solve three to four questions. I want to solve more, but I am thinking about how to do. Maybe I should learn more DP, tree, and graph, or I need to do much more practice.</p>

		<p>Because of COVID-19, the beginning of summer vacation in Taiwan changed from 7/1 to 5/12. It sounded great to students. But it was terrible news to many parents. To me, it‚Äôs time for me to learn and practice more about programming techniques.</p>
